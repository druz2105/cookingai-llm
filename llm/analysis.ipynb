Count me in! This healthy, easy Blueberry Smoothie made with yogurt truly delivers the best of all worlds.\\n\\nEmail Me the Recipe!\\n\\nEnter your email below to save this recipe to your free Well Plated recipe box.\\n\\nFrom time to time, we'll send you the best of Well Plated. Already registered? Log in here.\\n\\nWhy You’ll Love This Easy Blueberry Smoothie\\n\\nIt Truly Tastes DELISH. Like my Watermelon Smoothie and Strawberry Smoothie, this blueberry smoothie tastes more decadent than it is. It’s bursting with fresh blueberry taste, yes, but what sets this Greek yogurt blueberry banana smoothie apart is that its flavor is reminiscent of a slice of fresh blueberry pie with a creamy scoop of ice cream. Yum and YUM!\\n\\nIt’s Packed with Nutrients. This smoothie (and all of my healthy breakfast smoothies) is an excellent way to sneak more protein and fruits into your day. Blueberries are an excellent source of vitamins, fiber, and antioxidants. Plus, they’re easy to keep in the freezer. Take the fiber-rich oats, calcium-packed Greek yogurt, and banana into consideration, and the blueberry smoothie benefits are endless!\\n\\nIt’s Easy to Adapt. While I typically enjoy this smoothie recipe exactly as it is written, like this Mango Smoothie and Green Smoothie, you can certainly adapt the ingredients to fit your needs or tastes. Toss in protein powder, greens, natural sweeteners (like maple syrup or honey), chia seeds, or anything else you enjoy!\\n\\n5 Star Review\\n\\n“This is one of the best smoothies I’ve made!! My new favorite and it is very filling.”\\n\\n— Kathryn —\\n\\nHow to Make A Healthy Blueberry Smoothie\\n\\nThe Ingredients\\n\\nFrozen Blueberries. While there are a handful of important blueberry smoothie ingredients, these are the star of the show!\\n\\nFrozen Banana. Banana is good in smoothies because it adds natural sweetness and helps give the smoothie its creamy texture. (For a blueberry smoothie without banana, try my Strawberry Blueberry Smoothie.)\\n\\nPlain Nonfat Greek Yogurt. Making this a blueberry smoothie with yogurt ensures it is protein-packed and extra satisfying. (Have extra yogurt on hand? Try this Greek Yogurt Smoothie.)\\n\\nRolled Oats. Oats give the smoothie body, make it more filling, and add a subtle “crust” vibe. (For another oat-packed option, check out this Oatmeal Smoothie!)\\n\\nAlmond Butter. Helps make the smoothie more satisfying and gives it rich flavor.\\n\\nVanilla + Cinnamon. The key ingredients that take this from being a basic blueberry smoothie to one that tastes like a blueberry pie in a glass.\\n\\nAlmond Milk. I chose to make this a vanilla almond milk blueberry smoothie, but you can use any milk you have on hand. Making this a blueberry smoothie recipe with milk helps us reach the ideal consistency.\\n\\nOptional Mix-ins\\n\\nProtein Powder. For an extra protein boost, add a scoop of your favorite protein powder. I like vanilla here.\\n\\nMaple Syrup. If you prefer a sweeter smoothie, add a teaspoon or two of pure maple syrup or honey. (To keep this recipe healthy, you should not mix refined sugar into a smoothie.)\\n\\nSpinach. Make this into a blueberry banana spinach smoothie by adding a handful of spinach to the blender. Spinach will alter the color of the smoothie a bit, but you won’t be able to taste it. (Don’t miss my Blueberry Spinach Smoothie and Avocado Smoothie for more green smoothie recipes.)\\n\\nSeeds. Full of healthy fats, antioxidants, and fiber, these little seeds pack a nutritional punch. Try chia seeds, hemp seeds, or flax seeds.\\n\\nThe Directions\\n\\nPrep. Add all the ingredients to a blender.\\n\\nBlend. Puree until smooth. ENJOY!\\n\\nStorage Tips\\n\\nTo Store. Cover and refrigerate leftovers for up to 1 day.\\n\\nTo Freeze. Freeze smoothies in an airtight, freezer-safe storage jar for up to 3 months. Let thaw overnight in the refrigerator before serving.\\n\\nMake-Ahead Tip\\n\\nYou can also make your smoothie in advance, then pour it into an ice cube tray and freeze for up to 3 months. When you are ready to serve, add your desired number of smoothie cubes to a blender and puree.\\n\\nWhat to Serve With a Blueberry Smoothie\\n\\nMuffins. Healthy Blueberry Muffins, Banana Oatmeal Muffins, or Coconut Flour Muffins would pair nicely with this refreshing smoothie.\\n\\nEggs. For a protein-packed breakfast, pair this smoothie with Easy Kale Feta Egg Toast, Egg Muffins, or Bagel Egg in a Hole with Smashed Avocado.\\n\\nOats. You’ll stay full for hours if you enjoy Overnight Steel Cut Oats, Apple Cinnamon Overnight Oats, or Instant Pot Steel Cut Oats with this recipe.\\n\\nBars. Breakfast Bars, Vegan Protein Bars, or Healthy Granola Bars would perfectly complement this smoothie.\\n\\nRecommended Tools to Make This Recipe\\n\\nBlender. This blender is an investment that has been completely worth it. This blender is also a very good, more economical option. (Both would be great for making this Kale Smoothie!)\\n\\nStainless Steel Straws. Everything automatically tastes more refreshing through these straws.\\n\\nRecipe Tips and Tricks\\n\\nChoose Your Nut Butter. As written, this smoothie uses almond butter. However, you can swap it for any nut butter you prefer (or make it nut-free butter instead).\\n\\nTry a Smoothie Bowl. Use my Smoothie Bowl recipe for inspiration, and turn this into a blueberry smoothie bowl by adding a few ice cubes and additional frozen blueberries to make it as thick as possible. (Try this Strawberry Mango Smoothie as a bowl next!)\\n\\nSip Before You Sweeten. This blueberry smoothie has lots of natural sweetness on its own, so I recommend trying a sip before adding any other sweeteners.\\n\\nSave Recipe Saved\\n\\n7.2kPinterestFacebookEmail\\n\\n7.2k\\n\\nSHARES\\n\\nReviewPrint\\n\\nBlueberry Smoothie\\n\\n4.75 From 31 reviews .

Super basic, thick and fluffy blueberry pancakes – melt in your mouth, golden brown, and bursting with blueberries.\\n\\nJump to Recipe\\n\\nFeatured comment\\n\\nThese pancakes are literally what dreams are made of. I LOVE pancakes & these are without a doubt my new faves!\\n\\nGem\\n\\n701 more comments\\n\\nHappily revisiting this recipe from last summer with a few recipe tweaks and updates! I made a hot and fresh batch on Instagram Stories today if you want to watch it come together!\\n\\nYou can fancify pancakes all you want, but can you really ever deny a butter-soaked blueberry pancake laced with maple syrup and dripping with hot, bursty blue juices?\\n\\nIf you can, you are probably not human.\\n\\nThese Are 5-Star Pancakes!\\n\\nYou guys are not going to believe this, but BJORK was the person who first made these pancakes for me. He went through a phase (it was definitely a phase as it seems to be done for now) where he would make pancakes for me on Saturdays, and in his very professional pancake research and extensive testing – LOLS – he came across an unfancy, unfussy recipe for a five-star batch of standard, fluffy, buttermilky pancakes.\\n\\nAnd do you know what? They are so good that they have permanently become our standard pancake recipe.\\n\\nThese are THICK, so if you don’t like thick pancakes, we might be in a little fight right now. They are just the right amount of sweet and melt-in-your-mouth delicious. The first few times I ate them, I ate them completely PLAIN. As in, no butter, no syrup, no nothing.\\n\\nDO YOU EVEN HEAR WHAT I AM SAYING? They were so good that I was eating. them. plain.\\n\\nPrefer To Watch Instead Of Read?\\n\\nSo we were already making these a lot. Sans blueberries, sans syrup. Just plain old LIFE-CHANGING pancakes.\\n\\nBut now that it’s summer and we are revisiting Costco for the sole reason of huge containers of ripe organic fruit, I have been unable to keep the fistfuls of blueberries out of my pancakes.\\n\\nAnd I regret nothing.\\n\\nThe Inspo For These Pancakes\\n\\nBjork’s AllRecipes pancake recipe base (modified slightly! you know how I am) plus a little assortment of fresh blueberries tucked in there for good measure?\\n\\nThis is the stuff of summery Saturday morning dreams.\\n\\nThis recipe serves 2 people, I’d say, which is kind of perfect for us because we don’t end up with 800 million pancakes leftover. But keep in mind that that’s coming from a pretty pancake-hoggy person – we make them big and we each eat multiples.\\n\\nFluffy pancake goodness. Blueberry pockets. Butter.

May we recommend fresh raspberries or chocolate chips?\\n\\nWhat can I substitute for buttermilk?\\n\\nJust a bit of milk and vinegar will work instead.

Whisk the egg, milk, and melted butter into the dry ingredients until just combined.\\n\\nHeat a nonstick pan over medium heat. Melt a little smear of butter in the pan (essential for giving a yummy golden brown crust).\\n\\nPour about 1/3 cup of batter into the hot skillet and spread it flat-like (it will be pretty thick). Arrange a few blueberries on top. Cook until you see little bubbles on top and the edges starting to firm up. Flip and cook for another 1-2 minutes until the pancakes are sky-high fluffy and cooked through.\\n\\nServe with butter and maple syrup. But honestly, sometimes I just like to eat these plain.

Just made these and while thee flavor was delicious, I couldn’t get them to cook inside without burning on the outside. I tried going down to medium heat, but then they just sat and sat and sat and got very dense by the time they were finally cooked through. I didn’t get many bubbles coming up either. Maybe I didn’t use enough vinegar? Do you have any suggestions?\\n\\n05/22/20 @ 11:39 am\\n\\nReply\\n\\nEman @ Pinch of Yum\\n\\nWe’d suggest turning down the heat a bit to see if that helps next time. Let us know how this goes!\\n\\n05/22/20 @ 12:39 pm\\n\\nReply\\n\\nJanet\\n\\nCheck the expiration date on your baking soda and baking powder as well. Dense with hardly any bubbles usually means either of those has lost the ability to make things rise. That also will result in burning. Good luck!\\n\\n05/31/20 @ 12:01 am\\n\\nReply\\n\\nEsther\\n\\nThank you for the recipe. They turned out great. I slightly reduced the amount of melted butter. I also added a quarter cup of butter milk as the mixture was too thick( I was using a fermented milk version that is thicker than normal buttermilk). Ther were fluffy and cooked through and delicious ! Definitely going to use this recipe again and again! Greetings from Nairobi, Kenya!\\n\\n11/12/22 @ 1:58 am\\n\\nReply\\n\\nVanessa\\n\\nBEST.

Also loved the milk and vinegar option as my husband is lactose intolerant so I was able to use his lactose free milk! It’s usually difficult for me to make pancakes for him that are nice and fluffy! This one is in my recipe box forever! BTW…my 13 year old son devoured them! Need to double the recipe going forward 😉 Thanks!\\n\\n05/30/20 @ 10:38 am\\n\\nReply\\n\\nEman @ Pinch of Yum\\n\\nWe haven’t tested these out using another flour yet. Depending on what you use, it should work.

This recipe is perfect–just sweet enough, and makes a manageable amount for two adults and one kiddo, sometimes with a few leftover. Thanks for the delicious recipe!

And of course margarine can be used too.\\n\\n07/26/19 @ 9:28 pm\\n\\nLucretia Johnson\\n\\nMilk+vinegar is an old time trick to make buttermilk. It is in all the cookbooks from the 50’s and 60’s. no one wanted to buy a whole container of buttermilk for 1 recipe and then more times than not the rest of the container would go bad.\\n\\n08/11/19 @ 1:16 pm\\n\\nReply\\n\\nLucretia Johnson\\n\\nBy the way the pancakes were delicious.

I made them according to the recipe with one exception- I put more oil in the pan because I like crispy edges on pancakes.

Baked to achieve that elusive light-yet-rich creamy cheesecake filling, studded with blueberries inside and smothered in an incredible glossy blueberry sauce topping. It’s magnificent!\\n\\nBlueberry Cheesecake\\n\\nI know sometimes the thought of a quick ‘n easy no-bake cheesecake recipe is enticing.\\n\\nBut if you want to make cheesecake the way it’s intended to be, with a filling that’s somehow fluffy but creamy at the same time, rich but not so dense that it sticks to the roof of your mouth, then a baked cheesecake is the way to go.\\n\\nAdd pops of blueberry littered throughout that lemony cheesecake filling, then OMG that insane glistening blueberry topping ….\\n\\nIt’s a sight to make a grown man weep. (Well, girl. 😂)\\n\\nCheesecake made easy\\n\\nDon’t let the number of steps you see visualised below daunt you. While cheesecakes aren’t usually pitched as a recipe for beginners, you don’t need to be an experienced cook to make mine. I’ll walk you through it so you can have confidence that you’ve got this, even if you’re a first timer.\\n\\nI’ve written the instructions out carefully, you’ve got step photos AND an instructional recipe video.\\n\\nAnd unlike cakes, you don’t need to worry about sinking and collapsing. So even a cheesecake that doesn’t go quite to plan is still going to be very, very good!\\n\\nBlueberry Cheesecake Components\\n\\nHere are the 3 parts to this Blueberry Cheesecake (which, by the way, is a rendition of this Strawberry Cheesecake, in case you’d like to browse reader feedback!):\\n\\nThe biscuit crust – I’m a cheesecake crust tragic. I just love the texture contrast of the sweet crunchy crust with that insanely creamy filling. So my cheesecake crusts go up the sides, rather than just being on the base. But you can skip the sides if you prefer;\\n\\nThe creamy rich-yet-light filling – a juxtaposition you can only achieve with baked cheesecakes, the consequence of which is that it’s not sickeningly rich (ie we can eat more! 🙌🏻);\\n\\nBlueberry sauce topping – with a syrup that drips slowly down the side of the cheesecake as you plough your way through it….\\n\\n1. Cheesecake biscuit crust\\n\\nHere’s what you need for the cheesecake crust – just plain sweet crackers (any type will do – loads of options listed in the recipe) and butter (the glue).\\n\\nHow to make the cheesecake crust\\n\\nBlitz to make crumbs (or bash a ziplock bag with a rolling pin – very therapeutic), mix with butter then press into the cake pan.\\n\\nTOP TIP: Make quick work of the crust by using something round with a flat base and straight walls to press the crumbs into the pan.\\n\\nEverybody thinks cheesecake biscuit walls are really fragile – but they are actually rather sturdy once the cake is cooled. I don’t have fairy fingers – and I’ve never destroyed one!\\n\\n2. Blueberry cheesecake filling\\n\\nHere’s what goes in the cheesecake filling. Standard baked cheesecake ingredients, with the addition of blueberries.\\n\\nCream cheese – must use block, not the spreadable cream cheese in tubs (too soft). If you can only get spreadable, just skip the sour cream;\\n\\nBlueberries – fresh or frozen is fine here. If using frozen, do not thaw it (otherwise it bleeds when you stir it in and you’ll end up with a purple cheesecake!);\\n\\nSour cream – lightens up the mixture a touch so it’s not ridiculously rich. Just 1/2 cup makes such a difference!\\n\\nFlour – just a tiny bit really helps stabilise the filling to keep it slightly aerated (rather than dense so it sticks to the roof of your mouth) and so it doesn’t collapse in the middle;\\n\\nEggs – the key ingredient that gives this cheesecake aeration. You don’t need to whip it – eggs just naturally rise when baked (you can see in these Egg Frittata Muffins how much egg rises);\\n\\nVanilla – for flavour;\\n\\nLemon zest – because the flavour of lemon is terrific to bring a touch of freshness to cheesecakes, and is a natural pairing with blueberries; and\\n\\nSugar – white, to keep the colour of the filling white.\\n\\nHow to make the cheesecake filling\\n\\nHere’s how the filling is made and baked:\\n\\nThe cheesecake filling is very straightforward to make – everything just gets mixed in a bowl, poured into the crust then baked.\\n\\nTIP: Only mix until each ingredient is incorporated and the batter is smooth. No need to beat to aerate the batter. If the filling is beaten too much and becomes very aerated, then the cheesecake might rise a lot in the oven which will cause cracks. Not a big deal though because flaws get hidden under the Blueberry Sauce!\\n\\nYou don’t need to fuss with a water bath to prevent surface cracks. That’s only required to rectify recipes that don’t make the filling correctly, bake at the wrong temperature, or for too long.\\n\\nWhy cool cheesecake in the oven?\\n\\nThe cake is cooled in the oven for two reasons:\\n\\nIf you cook the cake all the way through in the oven, it puffs up too much which causes surface cracks; and\\n\\nTo keep the cheesecake creamy inside. The oven is turned off before the cake is fully cooked, then it finishes cooking in the turned off oven. The gradual drop in temperature creates an environment such that the cheesecake finishes cooking but cannot overcook.\\n\\n3. Blueberry sauce for the cheesecake\\n\\nHere’s what you need for the blueberry topping:\\n\\nBlueberries – frozen or fresh is fine here;\\n\\nSugar – to create the syrupy consistency;\\n\\nVanilla – for flavour;\\n\\nLemon – to cut through the sweetness and because it goes so well with blueberries; and\\n\\nCornflour/cornstarch – to thicken the syrup so it drips slowly down the cake when you cut it, rather than running everywhere.\\n\\nHow to make blueberry sauce for cheesecake\\n\\nWe cook some of the blueberries with the sugar, lemon and vanilla so they break down to create the vibrant purple sauce.\\n\\nThen stir in cornflour/cornstarch to thicken, and lastly stir in whole blueberries.\\n\\nWord of warning: this blueberry sauce stains! The pictured wooden spoon is now permanently purple!\\n\\nBlueberry Cheesecake FAQ\\n\\nCracks occur because the cheesecake rises too much. This can happen because filling that was beaten for too long so it aerated too much, or overcooking.\\n\\nExcess beating = aerated batter = cheesecake rises too much = cracks in surface\\n\\nOvercooking = cheesecake rises too much = cracks in surface\\n\\nBut don’t forget, it doesn’t matter if your cheesecake cracks because you’re smothering it with sauce!\\n\\n3 key tips:\\n\\nMake sure you don’t over beat the batter by using room temperature ingredients so they incorporate faster, and follow my recipe beating time directions;\\n\\nCook in a moderate oven, not hot – if the oven is too hot, the cheesecake will rise too fast, causing the surface to crack;\\n\\nTurn the oven off while the cake is still jiggly (partially undercooked) then leave it in the turned off oven to cool – it will finish cooking during this time.\\n\\nPlay the clip below to see how jiggly the cheesecake should be when you turn the oven off – more jiggly than you’d expect!\\n\\nNO. Though you’ll see many recipes swearing by the water bath method to ensure the surface of your cheesecake doesn’t crack, it’s not necessary if you make the filling properly, don’t over beat, cook in a moderate oven and don’t overcook.\\n\\nIn fact, when I published the Strawberry Cake recipe, I did a side by side comparison of water bath vs no water bath cheesecakes. As you can see in the photo below, there is no difference in the surface of the two cheesecakes – except the water bath one was a LOT more of a hassle to get into the oven!\\n\\nI feel your pain – that was the disaster that occurred to me with my very first cheesecake!\\n\\nHere’s how to make it easy (and safe) to remove your cheesecake: flip the base UPSIDE DOWN, line it with baking/parchment paper and secure the sides so the excess paper is sticking out.\\n\\nIf you do this, you don’t need to lift the cheesecake over the ridge of the base, it just slides right off. Similarly with the paper, grab the overhang then push the cheesecake off the paper. Voila! Cheesecake in tact!\\n\\nThis is how jiggly the cheesecake should be when you turn the oven off:\\n\\nAlso note how it’s quite puffy and even a big sunken in the middle. That doesn’t matter because it sinks back down to a level surface once it cools in the oven.\\n\\nBlueberry sauce optional!\\n\\nI know I’ve been going on and on about how great the blueberry sauce is. And it certainly adds an extra special touch here, but I only do it when blueberries are in season – and cheap! Because this cheesecake calls for 250g/8oz blueberries IN the cake (2 Australian punnets) and 375ml / 13oz ON the cake (3 punnets)\\n\\nFor the rest of the year, I only use blueberries inside the cake and a serve it with cream.\\n\\nNobody has ever complained.😉 – Nagi x\\n\\nWatch how to make it\\n\\nHungry for more?

To say this Blueberry Cheesecake is bursting with blueberries is an understatement! Baked to achieve that elusive light-yet-rich creamy cheesecake filling, studded with blueberries inside and smothered in an incredible glossy blueberry sauce topping. It\\'s magnificent!\\n\\nDon\\'t be daunted by the number of steps – they are straightforward, I\\'ve just broken it down into managable steps. Cheesecakes are actually less \"risky\" than cakes because – no worries about not rising, sinking in middle etc.\\n\\nIf blueberries are expensive right now but you\\'re absolutely busting to make this, skip the topping and serve with cream instead.\\n\\nIngredients\\n\\nCheesecake Biscuit Base:\\n\\n200g/7 oz Arnott\\'s Marie crackers or other plain biscuit (Aus) or 28 Graham Cracker squares (Note 1)\\n\\n120g / 8 tbsp unsalted butter , melted\\n\\nCheesecake Filling:\\n\\n1 lb / 500g cream cheese , well softened (Note 2)\\n\\n2 tbsp flour , plain/ all purpose flour\\n\\n1 tsp vanilla extract\\n\\n1/2 cup sour cream (full fat, sub yogurt)\\n\\n1 1/2 cups caster sugar (superfine sugar)\\n\\nZest of 1 lemon (can skip)\\n\\n3 eggs , at room temperature\\n\\n250g / 8oz blueberries (Note 3)\\n\\nBlueberry Topping for Cheesecake:\\n\\n375g / 13 oz blueberries (Note 3)\\n\\n2 tbsp lemon juice (or water)\\n\\n1/2 cup white sugar\\n\\n1/2 tsp vanilla extract\\n\\n1 1/2 tsp cornflour/cornstarch\\n\\n2 tbsp water\\n\\nPrevent screen from sleeping\\n\\nInstructions\\n\\nPreparation:\\n\\nPreheat oven to 160°C/320°F (140°C fan). Place shelf in middle of oven.\\n\\nLine inverted base: Get a 20cm/8\" springform cake tin. Turn the base UPSIDE DOWN (Note 4), butter lightly then press on a square piece of parchment/baking paper. Then clip into the springform pan – excess paper will stick out, see photos in post and video.\\n\\nLine sides: Butter and line the side of the pan.\\n\\nCheesecake Biscuit Base:\\n\\nBreak up biscuits roughly by hand and place in a food processor.\\n\\nBlitz until fine crumbs. Add butter, briefly blitz until dispersed and it resembles wet sand.(Note 5)\\n\\nPour into the prepared cake tin. Use a spatula to roughly spread it out over the base and up the walls.\\n\\nUse something with a flat base and vertical edges (I use a measuring cup) to press the crumbs up the wall almost to the top of the sides, and flatten the base.\\n\\nFilling:\\n\\nCream cheese: Use a stand mixer (with paddle) or handheld beater to beat the cream cheese until just smooth, no longer than 20 seconds on speed 4. (You do not want to aerate cheesecake filling too much as it causes cracks when it bakes)\\n\\nAdd flour, beat for 5 seconds on speed 4 until just incorporated.\\n\\nAdd vanilla, sour cream, sugar and lemon zest. Beat until just combined (10 sec max, speed 4).\\n\\nEggs: Add eggs one at a time – beat for 5 seconds on speed 4 in between each. After the last egg, beat as needed until batter is smooth – but stop beating immediately once smooth.\\n\\nBlueberries: Stir in blueberries with a rubber spatula. Pour into prepared crust.\\n\\nBake: Bake for 70 minutes. The top should be a bit puffed, very light golden brown, not cracked, and near perfectly flat. It should jiggle slightly when you gently shake the pan, see video at 1 min 23 sec (sets in next step).\\n\\nCool: Cool the cake in the oven with the door open approx 20 cm / 8\" for about 2 hours (Note 6), then refrigerate for 4 hours+ in the pan or overnight. Cake will sink and surface should be flat.\\n\\nRelease: Remove sides of springform pan. Use overhang paper to slide cheesecake off the cake pan base. Then slide the cheesecake off the paper.\\n\\nBlueberry Sauce for Cheesecake:\\n\\nPlace 1 cup of blueberries (125g/4oz), vanilla, sugar and lemon juice in a saucepan. Stir then bring to simmer over medium heat. Simmer for 7 minutes until blueberries breakdown.\\n\\nMix cornflour and water, then stir in – it wil thicken quickly.\\n\\nStir in remainig blueberries. Sauce should be syrupy – remove from stove and cool. Will thicken as it cools.\\n\\nOnce cool, stir. Adjust thickness 1/2 teaspoon of water at a time to make it the perfect \"oozing\" consistency (see video, Note 7) – be careful, don\\'t make it runny!\\n\\nSpoon onto cheesecake so it\\'s completely covered – you\\'ll have maybe 1/2 cup sauce left, good for touch ups. Refrigerate 2 hours+.\\n\\nSlice and serve!\\n\\nRecipe Notes:\\n\\n1. Biscuits: Any plain sweet biscuits or crackers will work fine here, you need 2 cups of crumbs.\\n\\nAustralia: Arnott’s Marie Crackers, Arrowroot and Nice are ideal, I’ve made it with all these.\\n\\nUS: Use 28 squares / 14 full sheets, yes I measured it with my last Graham Cracker packet I brought back from my last trip.\\n\\nUK: Digestives are ideal, I LOVE digestives!\\n\\nThe crumb should be like wet sand so when pressed, it stays packed firmly, especially up the wall. It’s delicate when uncooked but once the filling is cooked, it becomes much more stable.\\n\\n2. Cream Cheese – In the UK and some parts of Europe, block cream cheese isn’t available. If you can only get spreadable cream cheese in tubs (softer than block), skip the sour cream.\\n\\nMake sure the cream cheese is quite soft but not melting. The softer it is = easier to beat until smooth = less beating = less aeration = no cracks. Too much beating = aerated cake = cake rises = cracks.\\n\\n3. Blueberries – fresh or frozen. If using frozen, do not thaw before adding into batter, and add 5 minutes onto the bake time.\\n\\nOther berries – blackberries and raspberries should work with no alteration to the recipe as they have similar cooking qualities to blueberries. For strawberries, use this Strawberry Cheesecake recipe.\\n\\n4. Inverted cake pan with overhang paper: The base of springform pans have a slight ridge. By inverting it, there is no ridge which makes it easier to slide the cheesecake on a serving platter without ruining the crust. There is no risk of batter leakage as the crust is thick enough to hold it all in.\\n\\n5. Crumbs: OR crush in a ziplock bag using a rolling pin or large can.\\n\\nAfter butter is added, it should just hold together when pressed between fingers.\\n\\n6. Cool in oven: This ensures creamy inside and stops surface from cracking:\\n\\nCracks occur due to oven temp too high or overcooking\\n\\nIn this recipe, you stop cooking when it’s still quite jiggly (see video at 1 min 23 sec) which means it’s actually still a bit undercooked in the middle\\n\\nBy leaving it in the oven, it finishes cooking but the declining temp stops it from overcooking\\n\\nIf you don’t do this step, you have to cook for longer in the oven to cook middle through which makes it rise too much = cracked surface and not as creamy inside\\n\\n(But if yours does crack a touch, it doesn’t matter – you’re smothering it in blueberry sauce!)\\n\\n7. Blueberry topping should be like thick syrup consistency, not a set jelly. It should ooze slightly when cut.\\n\\n8. Different measures: Cups and spoons vary slightly between countries (US and CAN are different to most of the rest of the world). I have made the cheesecake recipe using both US and Australian measures, using Australia Marie crackers and US Graham Crackers. The Graham Cracker crust is slightly crunchier because the biscuit doesn’t crush to a fine sand like Marie Crackers do. Both are delicious!\\n\\n9. Make Ahead / Storage: Cake is at its best consumed within 4 days, after that I feel like it starts getting denser but still really fab, most people wouldn’t notice a difference! Ideal to top the day or or day before. After 2 to 3 days, the top does start to “sweat” but it’s not very noticeable.\\n\\nNutrition Information:\\n\\nCalories: 489cal (24%)Carbohydrates: 55g (18%)Protein: 5g (10%)Fat: 28g (43%)Saturated Fat: 15g (94%)Cholesterol: 114mg (38%)Sodium: 284mg (12%)Potassium: 184mg (5%)Fiber: 1g (4%)Sugar: 41g (46%)Vitamin A: 945IU (19%)Vitamin C: 24.6mg (30%)Calcium: 80mg (8%)Iron: 1.4mg (8%)\\n\\nKeywords: Baked Cheesecake, blueberry cheesecake, blueberry recipes\\n\\nDid you make this recipe?I love hearing how you went with my recipes!

It was the first time I made it and it was delicious! I just need to learn to tweak the biscuit base a bit so it doesn’t crumble, spread the butter better like you wrote. Good tip with the cooling in the oven, that worked well. I used quark (curd cheese), so it’s a little less fat and more common in Germany and Switzerland. Thank you very much, this will be my favorite cheesecake recipe when I bake one again.\\n\\nReply\\n\\nRose says\\n\\nJuly 20, 2024 at 6:00 am\\n\\nHi Christa, I am living in Germany and it will be great to know whether you only used Quark (Magerquak?) or Quark+Schmand?

We needed to make it Gluten Free so used a combo of GF scotch finger and GF arrowroot biscuits, and a bit less butter. Also GF flour in the filling mix. We used frozen blueberries so needed a bit more time in the oven due to that (more like 15 mins rather than 5) but other than that followed the recipe and it was so many berries!! Delish!!\\n\\nReply\\n\\nRobin L Cardinal says\\n\\nNovember 17, 2023 at 9:43 am\\n\\nI have made this recipe twice and will make it for Thanksgiving this year. I use a lemon/almond cookie crust and follow all the remainder of your directions.

I’m cooking a half sized version of this recipe, do you have a recommendation on a shorter cook time? Or do I just keep an eye on it and hope for the best? 🤣\\n\\nReply\\n\\nFaye K says\\n\\nOctober 14, 2023 at 4:16 pm\\n\\nThis was my second attempt making a baked cheesecake & wow was this delicious! I used Digestive biscuits for the base, replaced one of the cream cheese blocks with Mascarpone instead & opted to use Greek yogurt instead of the sour cream. I also cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup, which was the perfect “sweet” (for me). The freshness of the blueberries bursting in my mouth with each bite…absolutely delicious! The topping was also delicious (I also used less sugar in this).\\n\\nI have decided to try the same recipe again, but have added tinned mango purée & will tops with passion fruit pulp. I’m a HUGE fan of the base recipe & I feel it’s very versatile with different fruits/flavours that can be used (or trialled in my case haha). Thank you!!\\n\\nReply\\n\\nGrace Ong says\\n\\nSeptember 22, 2023 at 5:35 am\\n\\nHi Nagi, Thank you for the recipe which I made tonight, for a friend’s birthday dinner tomorrow.

I remedy this now by placing the tin onto a sheet pan (to catch any butter leaks). We absolutely love this delicious cheesecake, so I’m not put off by this issue 🙂\\n\\nReply\\n\\nJen says\\n\\nSeptember 12, 2023 at 11:27 am\\n\\nIs this cheesecake suitable for freezing (prior to adding the topping)?\\n\\nReply\\n\\nOlder Comments'),\n",
